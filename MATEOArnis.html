            Arnis, also known as kali or eskrima/escrima, is the national martial art of the Philippines.[3] These three terms are, sometimes, interchangeable in referring to traditional martial arts of the Philippines ("Filipino Martial Arts", or FMA), which emphasize weapon-based fighting with sticks, knives, bladed weapons, and various improvised weapons, as well as "open hand" techniques without weapons. <br><br>

            There were campaigns for arnis along with other Philippine martial arts to be nominated in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists; and as of 2018, UNESCO has inscribed nine martial-arts-related intangible heritages.

        History of Arnis
        
    </h2>

    <p class = "margin">
        The origins of Arnis can be traced back to the pre-colonial period of the Philippines, with some historians suggesting that its roots may extend even further into ancient times. The archipelagic nature of the Philippines, comprising over 7,000 islands, led to the development of various fighting styles across different regions. These styles were influenced by the unique geographical, cultural, and historical contexts of each area, resulting in a diverse range of techniques and approaches within the broader umbrella of Arnis. <br><br>

        During the Spanish colonial period (1565-1898), the practice of Arnis faced significant challenges. The Spanish authorities, wary of potential uprisings, implemented strict regulations on the possession and use of weapons by the native population. This led to the concealment of Arnis training, often disguised as folk dances or theatrical performances. Despite these restrictions, Filipino martial artists managed to preserve and pass down their knowledge through secretive means, ensuring the survival of Arnis through generations.<br><br>

        Following the end of Spanish rule and throughout the 20th century, Arnis experienced a revival and modernization. Prominent martial artists and organizations worked to standardize techniques, develop formal curricula, and promote Arnis both within the Philippines and internationally. This period saw the emergence of various schools and styles, each contributing to the rich tapestry of Arnis as we know it today.

            12 Striking Techniques
            
        </h2>

        <img src="b.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" width="600" height="400">
    <ul>
        <li>
            #1 – Left side of the head attack. From the fighting stance, the warrior will hold the stick with one hand at 1 o’clock.

            He will then move the stick in a slashing action while keeping the free hand on the chest.
            
            This is a diagonal downward forehand swing to the left temple.
        </li>

        <li>
            #2 – Right side of the head attack. Like the left temple strike the warrior assumes fighting stance, this time with the stick held at 11 o’clock and the free hand kept on the chest.

            The strike to the right temple is then done in a diagonal downward backhand swing.
        </li>

        <li>
            #3 – Left side of the body or torso, to the left arm or elbow. In this strike, the practitioner will extend the weapon hand.

            Then he will proceed to strike any part of the trunk located between the shoulder and the hips. The stick will be held in a diagonal forehand slashing swing.
            
            This is the way to deliver the maximum amount of damage.
        </li>

        <li>
            #4 – Right side of the body or torso, to the left arm or elbow. Again the practitioner will extend the weapon hand to strike any part of the body located on the right side between the shoulder and the hips.

            The weapon of choice will be moved in a backhand slashing swing.
        </li>

        <li>
            #5 – Thrust to the stomach. This is a strong thrust to the solar plexus or the stomach and can cause fatal damage to the vital organs in the abdomen.

            In this strike, the practitioner will thrust the weapon hand to the target point, which is the solar plexus.
            
            It is then followed by an upward motion that will cut through the opponent’s body.
        </li>

        <li>
            #6 – Left chest stab. In this strike, the practitioner will assume the fighting stance with the weapon of choice in his hands.

            The weapon hand is then extended to the front with the palm facing outward and the elbow kept up. This strike can cause real damage to the rib cage.
            
            A weapon like a knife, spear or sword will end your opponent’s life immediately as it punctures the lungs and the heart.
        </li>

        <li>
            #7 – Right chest stab. After assuming fighting stance, the practitioner will practice the scooping action.

            The weapon hand is then extended forward with the palm facing outward.
            
            The elbow should be kept up in order to deliver an efficient strike to the right lung that will puncture it and end your opponent’s life immediately.
        </li>

        <li>
            #8 – Left lower leg. A practitioner here will try to deliver a powerful strike to the lower leg, targeting the knee, the shin or the ankle.

            The aim of the strike is to throw your opponent off balance and immobilize him.
            
            Using the right weapon, you might be able to break a bone or even cut a limb.
            
            The warrior is supposed to lower his body while extending the weapon arm.
            
            He should hold the palm upward and hit any part of the lower leg.
        </li>

        <li>
            #9 – Right lower leg. This strike is just like the previous one.

            The practitioner will extend the weapon hand and lower his body to hit the knee, the shin or the ankle.
            
            This time the palm should face downward.
        </li>

        <li>
            #10 – Left eye poke. A targeted thrust to the eye socket will not just blind your opponent, but will also deliver real damage to the brain.

            Using a sharp weapon like a sibat or the right baston can end your opponent’s life right there.
            
            The practitioner should assume fighting stance then extend the weapon hand forward with the palm facing outward and the elbow kept down.
        </li>

        <li>
            #11 – Right eye poke. This thrust is similar to the previous one except that the practitioner will have to hold his elbow down.

            This will allow him to hit the eye precisely with the right weapon penetrating all the way through to the brain.
        </li>

        <li>
            #12 – Strike to the crown/top of head. This is a straight downward overhead swing directed towards the crown of the head.

            Hitting the top of the head can immobilize your opponent, deliver damage to the brain and throw him off balance.
            
            Using a real sharp or powerful weapon can even shatter the skull bones ending the fight to your favor in a matter of seconds.
        </li>
